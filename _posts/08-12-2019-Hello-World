College dropout, still in love with linguistics and neuroscience; English teacher, and martial arts enthusiast; Led an obscure career and that's kind of a bummer.

Earlier this year, I decided to pursue knowledge in computer science and practice in programming. I will try to explain the reason behind it later in upcoming posts.
In the meantime, this July, I've begun studying programming with Code States, a bootcamp based in Korea, which has been serving as a nth leg of my journey.

```
String str = "And it's been hard.";
System.out.printIn(str);

```

I'll be posting a couple logs every week to document and review what I learned along the way.
