title: Damn it, World

Earlier this year, I decided to pursue knowledge in computer science and practice in programming. I might write about the reasons later in upcoming posts.
In the meantime, this July, I've begun learning JavaScript with Code States, a bootcamp based in Korea, serving as a nth leg of my journey.

```JavaScript
String str = "And it's been hard!";
Return str;
```

I'll be posting a couple logs every week to document and review what I learned along the way.
