Week 2 (07/29 ~ 08/04)
### This Week I Learned...

Write a function called "findShortestOfThreeWords".
Given 3 strings, "findShortestOfThreeWords" returns the shortest of the given strings.
If there are ties, it should return the first word in the parameters list.

So I broke the question down to small steps:
  // 1) take three words
  // 2) get the length of each word
  // 3) return the shortest length of word
get str.length

Write a function called "computePower". 
Given a number and an exponent, "computePower" returns the given number, raised to the given exponent.

I initially wrote
```JavaScript
function computePower(num, exponent) {
  num = Math.pow(num, exponent)
  return num;
}
```
and later learned that a shorter version is possible:
```JavaScript
function computePower(num, exponent) {
 return num**exponent
}
```
