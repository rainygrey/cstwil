College dropout, still in love with linguistics and neuroscience; English teacher, and martial arts enthusiast; led an obscure career and that's kind of a bummer. So, I've decided to make a few changes. Can't change my upbringing, but I can try raising myself into a programmer.

Good luck with this!
